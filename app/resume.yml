          and interests. I spent over a year working on the concept in my off-time. In the end, I created
          the product in too much of a vacuum. It was a hard lesson learned in the importance of keeping a product
          simple and getting it in front of actual users as soon as possible. It was also probably my masterpiece
          in terms of clean and maintanable C# code - another reason why the project failed as the time should have
          been spent elsewhere.
